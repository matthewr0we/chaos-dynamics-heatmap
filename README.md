# chaos-dynamics-heatmap
python code to create a mesh based off the expansion factor of initial conditions for a system in chaos dynamics

this code was part of a project i undertook at uni. it uses various ideas from linear algebra in an applied setting to specifically model the changes in expansion factor as the initial conditions are altered. 

this code is specifically for the "tinkerbell map" which is very sensitive to changes in the initial conditions
